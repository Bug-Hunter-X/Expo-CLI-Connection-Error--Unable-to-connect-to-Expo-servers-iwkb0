This error typically occurs when the Expo CLI is unable to properly connect to or interact with the Expo servers.  This could be due to network connectivity issues, problems with your Expo account, or a temporary outage on the Expo servers. The code itself isn't directly faulty; instead, it's the interaction with the Expo ecosystem that fails.  For example, trying to run `expo start` might result in this error if the network is down.
