The solution involves troubleshooting network connectivity, verifying Expo account status, checking the Expo server status, and potentially reinstalling the Expo CLI. 

1. **Check Network Connectivity:** Ensure a stable internet connection is active. Try pinging expo.io to see if you can reach the servers.
2. **Verify Expo Account:** Log in to your Expo account and check for any issues or errors.
3. **Check Expo Server Status:**  Check the Expo status page for any reported outages or maintenance. 
4. **Reinstall Expo CLI:** If other steps fail, uninstall and reinstall the Expo CLI: `npm uninstall -g expo-cli` followed by `npm install -g expo-cli`.
5. **Proxy Settings:** If you're behind a proxy, ensure your proxy settings are correctly configured in your environment variables or within npm's config.
